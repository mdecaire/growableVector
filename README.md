# growableVector
I am trying to learn C++.
This is my solution to a hacker rank problem for growable arrays. 
Problem:
Several lines of integers are fed into the program. 
The first line and column indicate how many rows are in the vector, 
second column indicates how many queries there will be.
next lines are the actual vectors, followed by the queries. 
The queries are simply the i,j coordinates of the number the query wishes you to find. 
the 0th number for each row in the vector indicates how many elements will be on that row.
The instructions were to use standard input otherwise I would have used scanf for this problem. 


The input is as follows:

2 2 //number of rows, and number of queries

3 1 5 4 // vector row one (3 numbers)

5 1 2 8 9 3 //vector row two (5 numbers)

0 1 //query one

1 3 //query two

The expected output of this is this sample:
5
9
